# UStep - Team 20
## Project Description
- Problem: People are unaware of how active they truly are
- Solution: An app that aggregates step data and provides feedback on your activity, gamifying the process with friends to promote them to be more active
- Key Features: Integration with step tracking software like apple health, samsung health, leaderboard, analysis of their steps with charts and graphs, adding friends and seeing their analysis
- Why this Project? This promotes people to stay active, while making the process fun. It is especially relevant in a college environment, where students are often stressed and sometimes neglect their physical well-being.
